####Code Cleaning
Cleanup random white space into a simple standard order.  Add unspecified access modifiers.  Utilize Visual Studio’s built-in formatting capabilities.  Remove and sort using statements.  And do it all automatically on save or on demand, from an individual file to the entire solution.

####Code Digging
Visualize and navigate through the contents of your C# and C++ files from a tree view hierarchy.  Quickly switch between different sorting methods to get a better overview.  Drag and drop to reorganize the code.  See McCabe complexity scores and informative tooltips.

####Reorganizing
Reorganize the layout of members in a C# file to follow Microsoft’s StyleCop convention, or your own preferences. Automatically generate regions to match. Run on demand or automatically during cleanup.

####Formatting
Format comments to wrap at a specified column and arrange tags on separate lines. Run on demand or automatically during cleanup.

####Joining
Join two adjacent lines, or a highlighted section of code onto a single line.

####Sorting
Sort a highlighted section of code alphabetically.

####Finding
