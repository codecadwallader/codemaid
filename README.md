###Overview
####Code Cleaning
Cleanup random white space into a simple standard order.  Add unspecified access modifiers.  Utilize Visual Studio’s built-in formatting capabilities.  Remove and sort using statements.  And do it all automatically on save or on demand, from an individual file to the entire solution.

####Code Digging
Visualize and navigate through the contents of your C# and C++ files from a tree view hierarchy.  Quickly switch between different sorting methods to get a better overview.  Drag and drop to reorganize the code.  See McCabe complexity scores and informative tooltips.

####Reorganizing
Reorganize the layout of members in a C# file and automatically generate regions.

####Formatting
Format comments to wrap at a specified column and arrange tags on separate lines.

####Joining
Join two adjacent lines, or a highlighted section of code onto a single line.

####Collapsing
Recursively collapse nodes or the entire tree in the solution explorer window.

####Progressing
View the overall progress of a build within Visual Studio, or in the Windows taskbar, both with a green/red status indication.

####Finding
Find the current file in the solution explorer window.

####Configuring
Enable, modify or disable many of the aspects of how CodeMaid does its work.

####Switching
Switch between related files, such as cpp and header files or xaml and code-behind.

####and More!
